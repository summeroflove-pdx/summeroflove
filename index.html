    const memories = [
    { title: "Bike Accident Anxiety", content: "We were in Bend, driving nowhere in particular, when suddenly a biker was in our path (I swear we had the right of way). We were in a stage where you were finally sharing your anxious thoughts with me, and your vulnerability sent me over the edge. I thought I loved you before then, but in that moment when you were worried you were being too much (you could never be too much), I knew for certain. When we finally made it to the healthy fast food spot, I cried in the bathroom because I was so in love with you and I wanted to tell you so badly. Your anxiety always gave you pause, but for me, it's one of the main reasons I love you." },
      { title: "One More Photo", content: "We were in Philly, and we had just gotten our warm (delicious) pretzels. We sat down to eat them, and Lauren started taking photos of you, me, Michael, and Cooper. She was about to put her phone down when you said, Wait, take one more, and you got up from your seat, pretzel in hand, and put your head on my head. You wanted to take a picture with me, and I swear my heart melted 🥹. I had never felt so desired by you. My heart still beats faster when I look at that photo of us." },
      { title: "Attachment Style Quizzes", content: "You ended things with me the day before, and naturally, I invited you over for dinner (because we are silly gooses). After we ate, we both sat on my couch and took quizzes that would help us identify our attachment styles. We read each other's results aloud to one another, saying each other's name before every bullet point, and we were cracking up the entire time. My heart fluttered at your interest in my wiring, your own attachment curiosity, and the vulnerability you showed that night. Even though things had ended the night before, I wrote in my journal - I think I might marry Matt. And truthfully, I still believe I will." },
      { title: "Tahoe Phone Call", content: "We were in the early stages, barely getting to know one another, when you had to go to Tahoe for a wedding. I decided to start sending you voice memos because I wanted to hear your voice (tbh), and to my surprise, you kept sending them back! These voice memos were actually the first time you paid me a compliment (it was about my eyes). You attended the wedding and sent me some hiking photos (per my request, but still gave you major points in my book), and on the way home, you decided to call me. I honestly have no idea what we were talking about, but it was just so nice to chat with you on the phone about nothing and everything while you drove back. The phone call only ended because you pulled into the complex and parked the car. We sat on my balcony, used my binoculars, and laughed and laughed. The first photo I took of you was of you with those binoculars. Gosh, I thought you were so damn hot (and I absolutely still do). PS. Christina made that reel of the Tahoe wedding, and I swear I watched the part where you wink over 100 times, and I had to pretend I hadn’t seen it when you showed it to me. " },
      { title: "First Valentine", content: "It was Valentine’s Day 2024, and you rang my doorbell to pick me up for our Calistoga dinner date. I didn’t see it live, but my Ring camera recorded you. When I played it back, I got to see you adjusting your suit and the flowers in your hand to make sure you were perfectly presentable for me. Not only that, but you wore the suit for me 😭🥹🔥. I cannot tell you how many times I have watched that video. You melt my damn heart! " },
      { title: "Calistoga Pop Up", content: "The Happy Hippy had a pop-up at Calistoga Motor Lodge, and not only did you show up, but you showed up with canned goods you purchased for the canned food drive 😭 How could anyone not love this thoughtful man? " },
      { title: "Down in the Valley", content: "I invited myself to see The Head & The Heart with you and your friends, and not only was I nervous to go, but I was also nervous in Target when you met me there to look for a blanket (which is why it seemed like I was running away). I will never forget how badly I wanted you to make a move, any move, while we were lying on the blanket eating those gross fries. I thought about accidentally placing my arm next to yours at the very least, but when we took our back-to-back photo for height comparison, I remember thinking how nice your back felt on mine. I was secretly hoping you were falling in like with me alllll night! ❤️" },
      { title: "Fire Place in Bend", content: "We had gotten back to the Airbnb after a night out in Bend, and we were lying in front of the fireplace talking and laughing (as per usual). My entire being ached for you (being in love with you was all that was on my mind at the bar, which is why I was mostly silent). I gently forced you to admit you had feelings for me, and I will never forget the intensity of dopamine, endorphins, and oxytocin that flowed through my body while we held one another in front of that fireplace after that. I knew I loved you before then, but holy cow did this moment help solidify it! PS. You actually took a live photo of me lying in front of the fireplace that trip, and I have listened to your laugh over 1,000 times, easily.  " },
      { title: "Eyebrows", content: "I had been thinking of removing my eyebrow tattoos for some time, and because of your encouragement, I went for it! The appointment came, and my brows were singed, white, and blistered. Despite looking insane, you made me feel so beautiful, and although I continued to care about the state of my brows, I cared wayyy less. Not only that, I came home to a care package full of white gifts thanks to my white brows. You are such a sweet and thoughtful man who always made me feel stunning, and it is absolutely one of the reasons why I love you. " },
      { title: "Girls Trip", content: "I was officially your girlfriend (🤩), and I went on a trip with my Pepperdine friends. I FaceTimed you really quickly to say goodnight, and we chatted and laughed for over an hour (surprised?) That night, on our call, I took a screenshot of you where you look *chefs kiss*. I have stared at that photo for an embarrassing amount of time. When I see that photo, I see My Matt, the man I love ❤️⭐️" },
      { title: "Concerts", content: "Any and all concerts where I stood behind you and held onto you the entire time was a freaking dream and a half! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 Being your big spoon really gets me going! " },
      { title: "Knee Slap", content: "We were celebrating your parents' anniversary at Carneros, and Jenny and James had just taken photos where Jenny was sitting on James’ lap. When they were done, you slapped your knee for me to climb on, and we took photos of our own. Sitting there laughing with you and your family meant the world to me! And seeing your confidence to do something like that was truly so hot!🔥 " },
      { title: "Food Poisoning", content: "I was coming to The Ranch for the first time, and I wasn’t feeling great. I mistook it for pre-meeting jitters, and the reality was so. much. worse. (well, you know!). Once we got back to my place, you ran out to get me supplies and sat with my head in your lap while I was crying/struggling ❤️❤️  My favorite part (as you know) was when you had to adjust yourself, and you said - Sorry! because you wanted me, even then!🔥 " },
      { title: "The Carson", content: "Apartment shopping with you in Portland hit different. We were having such a blast, cracking up, and I was FIGHTING the urge to hold your hand. I loved joking with you about you bending me over the windowsill, crying about the height on the floor, and spending time with you with no agenda. I love that we can have fun together doing the most mundane tasks! " },
      { title: "Location Sharing", content: "I had been sharing my location with you for some time, and one day, you shared yours with me and said you liked the idea of me knowing where you were 😭🥹 The action and sentiment were enough to make me fall in love all over again! I felt so desired and respected by you ❤️ " },
      { title: "See My Face Friday", content: "You made a video where you were making fun of me (not nice, actually!), and I have watched it too many times to count. I think you are hilarious (link in bio for that) and so freaking adorable! Our banter is absolutely one of the many reasons why I love you! 💖 " },
      { title: "Eye Spy", content: "When you smile, one of your cute, perfect little eyes squints more than the other (mine does too), and I am OBSESSED with it! ❤️‍🔥 " },
      { title: "Saint Patrick's Day Race", content: "I was finishing my first Portland 5k, and I was scanning the crowd because I had the slightestttt feeling baby would show up, and I was still shocked when I saw you there, looking back at me! Ugh, what a sweetheart! You were always my biggest cheerleader, and seeing you there was the push I needed to cross the finish line! ❤️" },
